Python Edinburgh is user group for Pythonistas in (surprisingly) Edinburgh.
This is a kick start of a group that died out unfortunately and only met once 
this year.

Find out more at the new (but basic) [website](http://www.pythonedinburgh.org/)
and [follow us on twitter](http://twitter.com/pythonedinburgh) or 
[join the mailing list](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/edinburgh).

The group is going to be meeting on the 4th Tuesday of each month. The next 
being on the 24th August at [Bert's Bar](http://www.bertsbar.co.uk/berts-bar/about/how-to-find-us.html).

Hope to see some of you there - please let us know if your coming so we can 
get the numbers right.
