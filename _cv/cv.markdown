I am a hard working highly motivated developer with proven skills in software design and development. I enjoy working as part of a team or working as a development lead. With a wide range of skills in web development I have worked in a number of different projects with small start-ups to traditional well established companies. I am interested in finding a challenging and interesting position where I can develop innovating and successful solutions to demanding problems. I also enjoy a highly active social life, meeting new people and travelling to get to know the world.

### Noteable Academic Projects

In my 4th year project for University I created an Ajax interface for phpMyAdmin, a highly popular open source database management system written in PHP. This project was very successful and was featured on sites such as Ajaxian.com.

For my Masters dissertation I worked on machine learning and successfully created a learning system that was able to improve its performance at playing Mancala over time. The system has implementations working with MiniMax Search tree, Evolutionary Algorithms, Neural Networks and Ant Colony Optimisation.
