I am a hard working highly motivated developer with proven skills in software
design and development. I enjoy working as part of a team or working as a
development lead. With a wide range of skills in web development I have
worked in a number of different projects with small start-ups to traditional
well established companies. I am interested in finding new challenges and
interesting position where I can develop innovating and successful solutions.
I also enjoy a highly active social life, skiing and travelling when I get a
chance.

### Noteable Academic Projects

In my 4th year project for University I created an Ajax interface for phpMyAdmin, a highly popular open source database management system written in PHP. This project was very successful and was featured on sites such as Ajaxian.com.

For my Masters dissertation I worked on machine learning and successfully created a learning system that was able to improve its performance at playing Mancala over time. The system has implementations working with MiniMax Search tree, Evolutionary Algorithms, Neural Networks and Ant Colony Optimisation.

### Community Involvement

I co-founded a Python Edinburgh user group in Edinburgh which has been running
for over a year now. With the group I have also successfully organised a
coding weekend and a small conference. I also try to attend and get involved 
with any user groups in the local area. I am also keen to try and contribute
back and help with open source projects where possible.
