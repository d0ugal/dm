I currently work on `OpenStack`_ full time as a senior developer for `Red Hat`_,
with the specific goal of making OpenStack easier to deploy and manage. To do
this I primarily work on `TripleO`_. You can see more of my specific
contributions `on Stackalytics`_

Before joining Red Hat, I had worked in the industry for around seven years.
The large majority of this was working for myself as a freelance developer and
contractor. During this time my company specialised in Python and Django
development.


Got any questions?
