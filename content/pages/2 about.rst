I'm a Python developer based in Glasgow, Scotland. I specialise in
Python development and solving challenging problems.

When I'm not coding I like to get out and about and particularly keen on
travelling. My biggest adventure to date was in South America with my
lovely girlfriend (`see the route I travelled`_ - all of that is by
ground except one flight from Lima to Buenos Aires).

I'm also an avid skier when its the right season and otherwise I'm
slowly getting into running and cycling.

Conferences and User Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'm a big advocate of the community and getting involved. I try to go to
as many conferences and user groups as I can. If the group doesn't
exist, I'll try and start it. I co-founded Python Edinburgh and then
later started Python Glasgow.

I'm a regular at EuroPython, PyConUK and DjangoCon.eu. I also
occasionally speak at conferences when I have the opportunity.

Development Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I mostly write Python in vim. When writing for the web I typically use Flask or
Django. This website however is a static website with Pelican - which is
awesome.

My current ideal general purpose web stack looks something like Nginx,
Gunicorn, Postgres, Python, Redis. However, this very much depends on the
project and other tools such as ElasticSearch make a great addition. I try to
automate all my systems administration work and even my local development
environment. For this I have used Chef but more recently I've been preferring
to use Salt Stack.

I work happily on MacOS and Linux.
