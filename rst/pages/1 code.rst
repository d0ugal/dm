I'm an active OpenSource developer, working on a number of
interesting projects. As must of my development is on GitHub you
can see most of `my activity there`_. I archive inactive projects
`on GitHub too`_.

I've been lucky and privileged to be in contact with some amazing
developers through open source.

These statistics are pulled live from the GitHub API with a
`small bit of JavaScript`_. The numbers reflect only the
repositories that originate from my account and thus don't
include those that I'm a contributor on but are owned by somebody
else.

.. _my activity there: https://github.com/d0ugal/
.. _on GitHub too: https://github.com/d0ugal-archive/
.. _small bit of JavaScript: https://github.com/d0ugal/dm/blob/master/dm/static/js/github-stats.js
