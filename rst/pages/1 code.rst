I try to get involved in open source projects when I am able to at work
and in my spare time. As I prefer to use git and the majority of the
large open source projects I use are on GitHub you will find most of `my
activity there`_.

I've been lucky and privileged to be in contact with some some amazing
developers through open source.

These statistics are pulled live from the GitHub API with a `small bit
of JavaScript`_
