I try to get involved in open source projects when I am able to at work or in my
spare time. As I prefer to use git and the majority of the large open source
projects I use are on GitHub you will find most of my activity there.

I've been lucky to have the privilege of being in touch of some amazing
developers through open source and like to think I help where I can.
