I'm a Python developer based in Glasgow, Scotland. I specialise in
Python development and solving challenging problems. When I'm not coding
I like to get out and about and particularly keen on travelling. My
biggest adventure to date was in South America with my lovely girlfriend
(`see the route I travelled`_ - all of that is by ground except one
flight from Lima to Buenos Aires). I'm also an avid skier when its the
right season and otherwise I'm slowly getting into running and cycling.

Conferences and User Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'm a big advocate of the community and getting involved. I try to go to
as many conferences and user groups as I can. If the group doesn't
exist, I'll try and start it. I co-founded Python Edinburgh and then
later started Python Glasgow.

I'm a regular at EuroPython, PyConUK and DjangoCon.eu. I also
occasionally speak at conferences when I have the opportunity.

Development Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I mostly write Python in Sublime Text 3. When writing for the web I
typically use Flask or Django. This website however is a static website
with Pelican - which is awesome.

My current ideal general purpose web stack looks something like Nginx,
Gunicorn, Postgres, Python, Redis. However, this very much depends on
the project and other tools such as ElasticSearch make a great addition.
I try to automate all my systems administration work and even my local
development environment. For this I have used Chef but more recently
I've been preferring to use Salt Stack.

I usually work within OSX but spend much of that time in iTerm 2 and
using Ubuntu (or, at least, Debian) virtual machines.
