I'm a Python developer based in Glasgow, Scotland. I specialise in Python
development and solving challenging problems. When I'm not coding I like to get
out and about and particularly keen on travelling. My biggest adventure to date
was in South America with my lovely girlfriend (`see the route I travelled`_ -
all of that is by ground except one flight from Lima to Buenos Aires).

Conferences and User Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'm a big advocate of the community and getting involved. I try to go to as many
conferences and user groups as I can. If the group doesn't exist, I'll try and
start it. I co-founded Python Edinburgh and then later started Python Glasgow.

I'm a regular at EuroPython, PyConUK and DjangoCon.eu. I've also recently
started speaking at these events with talks about ElasticSearch and Postgres in
relation to Python.

Development Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I mostly write Python in Sublime Text 3. When writing for the web I tpyically
use Flask or Django. This website however is a static website with Pelican.

My current ideal general purpose web stack looks something like Nginx, Gunicorn,
Postgres, Python, Redis. However, this very much depends on the project and
other tools such as ElasticSearch make a great addition. I try to automate all
my systems administration work and even my local development enviroment. For
this I have used Chef but more recently I've been preferring to use Salt Stack.

I usually work within OSX but spent much of that time in iTerm 2 and using
Ubuntu (or, at least, Debian) virtual machines.
