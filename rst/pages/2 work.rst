I am current a senior developer at Red Hat working on OpenStack and more
specifically working on OpenStack Management. We are working to make it
easier to manage, deploy and monitor your OpenStack deployment.

From 2012 to 2013 I worked for `Artirix`_ Ltd as a Senior Developer. I
specialised in working with data and search to help meet our customer
needs. We offered a hosted search platform and more bespoke custom
solutions for clients too. My work was 100% Python, building backend
systems and services.

Since early 2006 I worked as consultant and developer. Largely
specialising in Python development. I've worked in both small companies
with only a handful of staff to large enterprise environments. The work
was very varied, interesting and exposed me to a large variety of
industries and development practices.

Got any questions?
