I currently work as a Python developer specialising in back-end systems
and services.

From 2012 to 2013 I worked for `Artirix`_ Ltd as a Senior Developer. I
specialised in working with data and search to help meet our customer
needs. We offered a hosted search platform and more bespoke custom
solutions for clients too. My work was 100% Python, building backend
systems and services.

Since early 2006 I worked as consultant and developer. Largely
specialising in Python development. I've worked in both small companies
with only a handful of staff to large enterprise environments. The work
was very varied, interesting and exposed me to a large variety of
industries and development practices.

Got any questions?
