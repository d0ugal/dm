I currently work for `Artirix`_ who are based in London but I work from home in
Glasgow. We specialise in working with data and search to help meet our customer
needs. We offer a hosted search platform and more bespoke custom solutions for
clients too.

Previously, I worked as consultant and developer since early 2006. Largely
specialising in development with Python. I've worked in both small companies
with only a handful of staff to large enterprise enviroments. The work then has
been over a very varied set of projects that I've thoroughly enjoyed.

Got any questions?
