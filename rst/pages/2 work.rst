I currently work for `Artirix`_, a London based company but I work from
home in Glasgow. We specialise in working with data and search to help
meet our customer needs. We offer a hosted search platform and more
bespoke custom solutions for clients too. My work is 100% Python,
building backend systems and services.

Previously, I worked as consultant and developer since early 2006.
Largely specialising in Python development. I've worked in both small
companies with only a handful of staff to large enterprise environments.
The work was very varied, interesting and exposed me a large variety of
industries and development practices.

Got any questions?
