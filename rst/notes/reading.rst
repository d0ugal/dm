:short_summary: A log of the books I've been reading.
:status: draft

This is a bit of an experiment. I've been getting into reading again recently
for the first time in a number of years. Despite most of my books being in the
Kindle app, I wanted to keep a record of what I've read, when I read it and
roughly what I thought. So, here it is.

Not too many books for now, I'll try and keep it updated over time.


World War Z - Max Brooks
------------------------
Mid 2013 - October 2013. I really enjoyed this, the style is writing is really
interesting as its formed of a number of interviews from after a Zombie outbreak
that is now somewhat under control.


The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared - Jonas Jonasson
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
November 2013. A quirky book that is often amusing and just plain odd. I was
hooked early as I just couldn't imagine how the story developed. The book is
primarily about an eccentric man, his adventurous life up to this point and then
one last big adventure!


Remote: Office Not Required - Jason Fried and David Hansson
-----------------------------------------------------------
November 2013. Being a remote worker myself, this may have been a bit like
preaching to the choir. However, I found it interesting none the less. The book
covers advantages, advice and problems with remote working. Quite a large part
gives ideas to help convince you manager or company to try it out. It's very
well written, easy to read and quite short. I managed to finish it in two
sittings.
