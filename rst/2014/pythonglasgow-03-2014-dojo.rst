We are hosting another `code Dojo`_! If you want a ticket, they are free, so
`quickly grab one`_ before they are all gone.

Python Glasgow is user group for Pythonistas in (surprisingly) Glasgow,
Scotland. The group is just over a year old now. We try to host a number of
different events and encouage new people of all skill levels to come along,
learn about Python and meet fellow Pythonistas.
