Back in November 2013 I started working in a `new position`_ and it required
me to get up to speed with OpenStack fast. I quickly learned that OpenStack is
huge. With over `100 repositories`_ and over `1000 unique contributors`_ in the
last 6 months [1]_ its quite a daunting prospect.

       release.
