**What is the coolest Python application, framework, or library you
have discovered in 2011?**

I started using Tox in all my projects this year. It's got to be one of the
best addition for testing multiple platforms and package versions.


**What new programming technique did you learn in 2011?**

I love testing, and have been good at writing tests for my code, but I've been
naturally moving towards a stricter TDD testing style, and I've been some
great benifits from this.


**What’s the name of the open source project you contributed the
most in 2011? What did you do?**

I contributed mostly to a number of my own new (or newly released) projects;
`html5video`_, `znc_mailer`_, `django-appregister`_. `django-urlmiddleware`_,
`django-consent`_, `django-gauge`_.


.. _html5video: https://github.com/d0ugal/html5video
.. _znc_mailer: https://github.com/d0ugal/znc_mailer
.. _django-appregister: https://github.com/d0ugal/django-appregister
.. _django-urlmiddleware: https://github.com/d0ugal/django-urlmiddleware
.. _django-consent: https://github.com/d0ugal/django-consent
.. _django-gauge: https://github.com/d0ugal/django-gauge


**What was the Python blog or website you read the most in 2011?**

Planet Python and Python Redit. I've also started reading Hackernews more,
which fairly often has Python related content.


**What are the three top things you want to learn in 2012?**

Pyramid, More of Python's internals, Haskell. The last has been on my list
for a while.


**What are the top software, app, or lib you wish someone would
write in 2012?**

I'd like somebody to build a CI server that uses ep.io to deploy testing apps
and run the tests and then deploy to the production app.
