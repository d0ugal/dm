:title: Joining Red Hat

Today is my first day working for `Red Hat`_ where I will be joining the
`OpenStack`_ teams. I will be specifically working on `Tuskar`_ under the newly
incubated `TripleO`_ project. Tuskar is focused towards creating, monitoring and
managing OpenStack installations.

I'm really excited about this new role and I'll no doubt be writing more on
the subject as I learn and find my way around.
